v0  creation of calibGenCAL package, add codes to generate calibration constants for CAL pedestal, slope and muon peak

v1 add codes to do the light taper study

v2 change calibration constants code: Change muon distribution fit function from landau to log normal. Add correlated pedestal finding method

v2r1 returned muon distribution fit from lognormal to landau.  made changes to get code to compile & run under windows/vc7.1.

v2r2 added ciFit app.  made sure that muonCalib could run w/ out specifying any histogram file.
