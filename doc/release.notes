v0  creation of calibGenCAL package, add codes to generate calibration constants for CAL pedestal, slope and muon peak

v1 add codes to do the light taper study

v2 change calibration constants code: Change muon distribution fit function from landau to log normal. Add correlated pedestal finding method
