v0  creation of calibGenCAL package, add codes to generate calibration constants for CAL pedestal, slope and muon peak

v1 add codes to do the light taper study

v1r0p0 In getGainsXML.cxx, change muon peak from 12.3 MeV to 11.2 MeV, 11.2 MeV is obtained by fitting MC energy spectrum deposited in a single crystal with a landau function, 11.2 MeV is the fit peak position while 12.3 MeV is the average value obtained from PDG.
