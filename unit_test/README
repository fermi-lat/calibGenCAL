calibGenCAL/unit_test contains:
        - environment is expected to be SLAC linux as input data files are available via nfs
        - unit_test_input - all input files required to run end-to-end calibGenCAL calibration 
        - unit_test_output - confirmed correct output files from same test.

instructions.
- setup CMT environment for calibGenCAL ('cmt config', source calibGenCAL/version/cmt/setup.(sh|csh|bat))
- extract unit_test_input  
> tar xvf $CALIBGENCALROOT/version/unit_test/unit_test_input.tgz
- cd into new unit test folder
> cd unit_test_input
- run make (some calibrations will fail validations, so we use '-k')
> make -k

diff the output files against those included in unit_test_output.tgz
